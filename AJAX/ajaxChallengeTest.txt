AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.
<br>

AJAX is not a programming language.
<br>
AJAX just uses a combination of:
<ol>
<br>
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
<br>
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
</ol>
<br>

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
<br>
<br>
How AJAX Works:
<br>

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
<br>
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
<br>
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
<br>
4. The server processes the request
<br>
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
<br>
6. The response is read by JavaScript
<br>
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
<br>
